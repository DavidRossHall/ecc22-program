Hello Enviro Chemist,

On behalf of the organizing team, we are delighted and privileged to welcome you to the 22nd Environmental Chemistry Colloquium (ECCXXII) at the University of Toronto. This yearâ€™s ECC will be held in person at the Evergreen Brick Works on May 8th and at the University of Toronto (St. George campus) on May 10th. In light of the uncertainties over the past few years during the global pandemic we are excited to come together in person once again. We would gladly like to welcome Brent and Nick for our career panel on May 8th to nurture new networks within our Environmental Chemistry Community.

We encourage everyone to take this time to interact with your peers and faculty. We strive to offer everyone an exciting and rewarding program, and we hope that you will have an enjoyable ECCXXII! 

Andrew, Carolyn, and Isla
