<h2>Exploring the potential of broadband complementary metal oxide
semiconductor micro-coil nuclear magnetic resonance for environmental
research</h2>
<p><em>Daniel Lysak and Andre Simpson</em></p>
<p>With sensitivity being the Achilles’ heel of nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), the superior mass sensitivity offered by micro-coils
can be an excellent choice for tiny, mass limited samples such as eggs
and small organisms. Micro-coils with sizes in the range of 100s of
microns have been reported to have mass sensitivity values orders of
magnitude higher than standard 5 mm probes, allowing for improved NMR
analysis of tiny samples.</p>
<p>A recent trend in microcoil NMR has been the use of complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based microchips which include an
integrated circuit containing all transceiver electronics. This “NMR on
a chip” approach provides several advantages over micro-coils interfaced
to discrete electronic components including: excellent sensitivity, the
ability to have a broadband coil for analysis of heteronuclei, decreased
parasitic losses by eliminating coil leads, and easy expansion to
multiple coils on a single chip, allowing increased sample throughput or
concurrent analysis of different samples. Here, the potential of CMOS
based devices for environmental research is investigated.</p>
<p>Numerous heteronuclei such as <sup>7</sup>Li, <sup>11</sup>B,
<sup>13</sup>C, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>23</sup>Na, <sup>27</sup>Al,
<sup>31</sup>P, and <sup>205</sup>Tl were detectable and <sup>13</sup>C
and <sup>19</sup>F were used to study two environmental samples: a
sprouting broccoli seed and a single <em>Daphnia magna</em> egg. The
<em>D. magna</em> egg was exposed to hexafluorobenzene, and the
contaminant was monitored within the egg by <sup>19</sup>F NMR. Overall,
broadband CMOS microcoils are shown to have significant potential for
environmental research.</p>

<h2>Investigating the impacts of warming and nitrogen-addition on
soil-derived dissolved organic matter</h2>
<p><em>Atzín San Román and Myrna Simpson</em></p>
<p>Dissolved organic matter (DOM) can account for as much as 5% of the
soil organic matter (SOM) found in forest soils. DOM represents the most
mobile and reactive carbon (C) fraction in forest soils, and it plays an
important role in global C cycling, helping to transport nutrients
within soil profiles and throughout aquatic systems. However, several
aspects of global environmental change amplified by human activities,
such as increased temperatures and nitrogen (N) deposition, can alter
soil microbial communities, and the biogeochemistry of DOM. Yet, there
is still a lack of molecular-level understanding of the biogeochemical
perturbations to the C cycle with respect to global environmental
change. Thus, this study aims to identify how warming, N-addition, and
warming + N alter DOM chemistry and cycling. To investigate this,
samples from the soil warming and nitrogen (SWaN) study at the Harvard
Forest Long-term Ecological Research site are analyzed after 4, 10, and
14 years of treatment (warming, N-addition, and warming + N). The
samples are characterized via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy to evaluate changes in the composition and degradation of
DOM in response to environmental changes. It has been noted that
N-addition can slow SOM decomposition while warming and warming + N can
accelerate decomposition. Thus, we expect to see similar trends with DOM
where warming + N will mirror warming, but not to the same extent.
Overall, this study will provide molecular-level insight into the unique
impacts of different environmental stressors on forests, both separately
and simultaneously.</p>

<h2>Atmospheric reaction in single levitated droplets under variable
humidities</h2>
<p><em>Chris Rusiewicz and Jamie Donaldson</em></p>
<p>Carbonaceous aerosols like Black carbon (BC) contribute considerably
to positive radiative forcing. Within the last two decades a new
classification has arisen describing a highly wavelength dependent
organic aerosol termed Brown carbon (BrC). Primarily emitted from
biomass burning, BrCs exact contribution to the radiative budget and its
fate inside the atmosphere are not fully understood. Previous work from
our group using acoustically levitated droplets containing water soluble
pine wood smoke showed a red shift in the absorbance spectra that was
partially attributed to heterogeneous photochemistry in the presence of
molecular oxygen. However, those experiments were carried out under very
low humidities, thus photo-oxidation occurred at the same time as
evaporation, complicating results. I have focused on increasing the
relative humidity to the deliquescence point of atmospherically relevant
inorganic salts to achieve a stable droplet. Droplets containing Phenol
Red can be easily measured by UV-vis absorption, and it was found that
droplet volume and spectroscopic measurements could be made stable over
time spans of hours. Introducing gaseous acid or base into the chamber
will induce a detectable and quantifiable pH shift which will be the
next objective. The ultimate future work will focus on quantifying the
observed red shifts in levitated droplets by using well-defined BrC
components and determining reaction pathways leading to the observed red
shift through composition analysis by high resolution mass
spectrometry.</p>

<h2>DREAMTIME NMR of slow spinning systems using High-Resolution-Magic
Angle Spinning</h2>
<p><em>Rajshree Ghosh Biswas and Andre Simpson</em></p>
<p>NMR spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique providing
molecular-level information in complex samples, non-invasively. However,
NMR suffers from some limitations, including low sensitivity, and large
spectral overlap from multiple chemical structures with similar
resonance frequencies. Moreover, due to magnetic susceptibility
distortions arising from inhomogeneous samples (gel-like tissues,
solution-like biofluids), signal broadening makes discerning metabolite
information difficult. High-Resolution-Magic Angle Spinning (HR-MAS)
alleviates this by spinning samples at high speeds (KHz range) to
dramatically narrow lineshape and improve sensitivity. However, at such
high spinning speeds (&gt;3000 Hz), biological tissue of organisms tends
to rupture thereby making <em>in vivo</em> monitoring difficult. Thus,
organisms must be spun slowly to improve their survival. For example, at
2500 Hz, freshwater shrimp (<em>Hyalella azteca</em>) can survive up to
14hrs, whereas at 500 Hz, this improves to ~ 48hrs. Moreover, organisms
must be maintained in a rotor of water to ensure their survival and
reduce magnetic susceptibility distortions. Unfortunately, at reduced
spinning, spectral overlap, water resonances and spinning artifacts
(spinning sidebands), hinders isolating and assigning specific
metabolites. To alleviate this, we apply the novel DREAMTIME NMR
technique to selectively isolate individual and multiple metabolites
from complex heterogenous mixtures under slow spinning, with improved
sensitivity. This study also introduces a new variation of DREAMTIME
(SLOWMAS) designed specifically for slow spinning to supress the broad
water resonances and its subsequent sidebands for <em>in vivo</em>
monitoring. Here, DREAMTIME SLOWMAS will be demonstrated for the first
time, using <em>ex vivo</em> worm tissue and compared to traditional
DREAMTIME NMR and water suppression techniques.</p>

<h2>Photoreaction aging of biomass burning brown carbon</h2>
<p><em>Carolyn Liu-Kang and Jonathan Abbatt</em></p>
<p>Biomass burning brown carbon (BrC) has been shown to significantly
impact global climate by influencing Earth’s radiative balance. It’s
ability to absorb light in the visible and ultraviolet regions
contributes to warming effects. However, a wide range of aging
mechanisms in the atmosphere can alter the composition and corresponding
optical properties of BrC, in both the aqueous and particle states. Due
to BrC’s chemical complexity, as well as these many aging processes, the
contribution of BrC to overall aerosol light absorption to remain highly
uncertain. Isolating each individual aging mechanism is key to
understanding the global picture of BrC’s behavior during its residence
time in the atmosphere. In this study, the link between the chemical
composition and the absorption properties of BrC from photoreaction,
i.e., light exposure, was investigated in both the aqueous phase and the
particle state. Pine wood was smoldered in-lab as the source of wood
smoke particles, followed by aging from ultraviolet light exposure
directly on filters (particle state), or after extraction in water
(aqueous phase). Changes in the optical properties were observed with a
UV-visible spectrophotometer, while potential radical formation was
monitored with an EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) spectrometer. In
addition, information on chemical composition before and after aging was
obtained with mass spectrometry techniques. Initial results show an
absorption enhancement following light exposure at short timescales.
Further investigation into concomitant reactants in play indicate the
important role of molecular oxygen in this aging mechanism, whereas
hydroxyl radicals do not play a role.</p>

<h2>Evaluation of irradiated Wyoming-type bentonite natural organic
matter at varying moisture levels</h2>
<p><em>James Neurauter and Myrna Simpson</em></p>
<p>Wyoming-type bentonite clay (MX-80) has been selected by Canada’s
Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO) as a deep geologic
repository buffer material. These bentonites are intended to facilitate
the isolation of used nuclear fuel and prevent radionuclide release as
an adsorbent. Water and natural organic matter (NOM) are present in
mined bentonite clays, and the latter may serve as a source of nutrients
for microbial activity, potentially inducing used fuel container
corrosion over time. As the proposed deep geologic repository buffer
material, Wyoming-type bentonite will be subjected to irradiation due to
its proximity to used fuel containers. This renders the radiolysis of
water a concern, as it promotes the formation of products capable of
oxidizing NOM and potentially accelerating microbial degradation. While
the diagenetic alteration of Wyoming-type bentonite NOM has been noted,
there is limited knowledge concerning the sensitivity of NOM chemistry
to irradiation at different water contents. To investigate this further,
molecular-level techniques were employed to assess compositional
differences of irradiated (100 kGy for 3 days) Wyoming-type bentonite
NOM samples with gravimetric water content levels ranging from 20% to
80% of the sample mass. The total, organic, and inorganic carbon
concentrations were determined via elemental analysis while solid-state
NOM evaluation was conducted via 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy, and targeted compound analysis was performed via gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This project will determine
whether products of water radiolysis increase the chemical reactivity of
Wyoming-type bentonite NOM, contributing to the substantiation of safe
and reliable used nuclear fuel storage.</p>

<h2>Integrated screening of bioactive contaminants contributing to the
high receptor activities in St. Lawrence beluga whales</h2>
<p><em>Holly Barrett and Hui Peng</em></p>
<p>While elevated tissue concentrations of pollutants have been reported
in St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE) belugas, the exact bioactive chemicals
exerting toxicity remain unknown. We integrated chemical analysis and
receptor activity screening to identify contaminants of potential
toxicity in SLE beluga liver and blubber and reference Arctic beluga
blubber.</p>
<p>Contaminants were extracted from pooled tissue of whales found
stranded from 1990-2017. Extracts were analyzed by mass spectrometry,
and results were matched to a database of known bioactive chemicals
(Tox21). ~200 matched compounds were significantly more abundant in the
SLE tissue than Arctic tissue. Extracts were tested for their activity
towards the AhR receptor to investigate the contribution of known and
unknown chemicals towards AhR-mediated responses, and significant
responses were detected (<em>e.g.</em>, 0.16 g/mL liver induced AhR).
Consistent with the more diverse chemical burden found in SLE belugas,
SLE tissue exerted significantly higher AhR activity than Arctic
blubber. Several AhR-active compounds detected through Tox21 screening
were found to partially explain the SLE activity, including natural
indoles and synthetic dyes. The extracts were then screened against a
suite of 48 human nuclear receptors (NRs), revealing significant
activities for several NRs. Distinct from Arctic blubber, the SLE
extracts exerted significant activity towards several NRs with functions
in cancer progression, such as the pregame X receptor (PXR). These
results mark the first time that receptor activity has been measured for
SLE belugas. Ongoing work focuses on using affinity pulldown nontargeted
analysis (APNA) to confirm the ligands responsible for the activity of
PXR and other NRs.</p>

<h2>NMR in an eggshell – in vivo carbon tracing and embryogenesis study
of Society Finches</h2>
<p><em>Katrina Steiner and Andre Simpson</em></p>
<p><em>In vivo</em> NMR is an insightful and powerful analytical
technique that permits the “real-time” analysis of samples in their
natural and unaltered states. These criteria are especially important
when studying intact biological samples and living organisms. A
particularly interesting application of <em>in vivo</em> NMR is in
embryo developmental studies. Limited <em>in vivo</em> NMR embryogenesis
studies have already been done on small amphibian and aquatic eggs, and
even less on mammalian eggs. The research presented here aims to
investigate carbon transformation pathways during embryo development of
Society Finch bird eggs via <em>In vivo</em> NMR techniques. Bird eggs
are an excellent model for environmental studies as they are highly
sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>A custom egg incubator (figure 1) is designed in a 15 mm NMR tube to:
(1) maintain proper humidity for egg development, (2) prevent egg
movement while inside the spectrometer, and (3) allow for instrument
locking using a D<sub>2</sub>O lock bulb. Radiofrequency pulsing and
powerful NMR gradients have the potential to cause sample heating which
can be problematic when studying biological systems. Thus, before
analysing fertilized bird eggs which are sensitive to temperature
change, it’s important to identify and eliminate such heating. Next,
fertilized bird eggs are analyzed using various 1D and 2D solution state
NMR experiments combined with filters and spectral editing to target
metabolites of particular sizes. Eggs are analyzed from day 1 of
fertilization to near hatching. Results of this study additionally have
the potential to provide the foundation for future embryotoxicity
testing using environmental contaminants.</p>

<h2>Haloacetonitrile toxicities attributed to distinct reactions with
proteins thiols</h2>
<p><em>Kirsten Yeung and Hui Peng</em></p>
<p>Disinfection by products (DBPs) are formed in disinfected/santized
water which have been correlated with incidences of disease such as
bladder cancer and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recently,
haloacetonitriles (HANs) have been highlighted as an emerging DBP with
stronger toxicities than regulated DBPs. This talk will elucidate the
toxicity mechanisms of HANs, including monoHANs and polyHANs, by
investigating their reactivity with protein thiols. Despite the ’simple’
structures of HANs, 3 disinct reaction pathways were observed which were
attributed to the various toxicities depending on the type and number of
halogens present. Both substitution and addition reaction pathways will
be discussed. Cytotoxicity and oxidative stress bioassays were employed
to determine the ability of various HANs to induce toxic effects and the
role of each HANs’ preferential reaction pathway in predicting harmful
effects in the human cell. The descending toxicity rank order by using
reporter cell systems is as follows: iodoacetonitrile ≈
dibromoacetonitrile, bromoacetonitrile, trichloroacetonitrile ≈
chloroacetonitrile ≈ dichloroacetonitrile. Activity based protein
profiling (ABPP) was used to image in vitro HAN adduction effects on
protein thiols in human cells. The ABPP rank order was similar to that
of the oxidative stress assays with differences among the
low/no-toxicity chlorinated species. The strong toxicity of
dibromoacetonitrile is unexpected, due to its unexpected debromination
and substitution reaction pathway(s) which were probed by both mass
spectrometry and NMR.</p>

<h2>Observing secondary organic aerosol formation from oxidation of
cannabis smoke</h2>
<p><em>Kristen Yeh and Jonathan Abbatt</em></p>
<p>Exposure to ultrafine fine particles (UFP) may lead to significant
health impacts due to their small particle size and high deposition
efficiency in the lower respiratory tract. Early studies of primary
emissions from cannabis smoke have identified several gaseous compounds
which have the potential to react with atmospheric oxidants. These
reactions form less volatile species which may contribute to secondary
organic aerosol (SOA) and UFP formation. Whether SOA and UFP formation
occurs during oxidation of cannabis smoke remains to be investigated.
This work aims to fill existing knowledge gaps by characterizing the
particle size distribution of primary aerosols emitted from cannabis
smoke and observing secondary organic aerosol formation when smoke is
exposed to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Cannabis smoke was introduced to an
environmental chamber connected to instruments for characterization of
particle and gas-phase emissions. For analysis of primary aerosols,
smoke was added to a chamber containing less than 5 ppb O3. When
observing SOA, smoke was added to a chamber containing approximately 100
ppb O<sub>3</sub>. Prior to ozone exposure, primary aerosol mass
concentrations were comparable to aerosol concentrations previously
observed in primary cigarette smoke. After ozone exposure, aerosol mass
concentrations were observed to increase. Additionally, a new mode of
particles in the ultrafine diameter range was detected after ozone
exposure. The diameter of the newly formed particles was observed to
increase over the aging period.</p>
