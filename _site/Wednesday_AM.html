<h2>Fate of the azole fungicide fluconazole in sunlit waters: kinetics,
transformation products, and reaction mechanisms</h2>
<p><em>William Fahy, Jonathan Abbatt, and Scott Mabury</em></p>
<p>The common antifungal pharmaceutical fluconazole is a persistent
organic pollutant regularly found contaminating bodies of water around
the world. Fluconazole can cause adverse health effects to at
environmentally relevant concentrations and has been shown to inhibit
the human cytochrome P450 system, which could slow metabolism of other
xenobiotics and lead to synergistic toxic effects. Little is known about
the environmental fate and transformations of fluconazole, although
existing work on biodegradation and advanced oxidation processing
indicates it is recalcitrant to many natural transformation pathways.
Here we used the PhotoFate system to investigate the indirect photolysis
of fluconazole in simulated sunlit freshwater environments. We estimate
a half-life with respect to indirect photolysis in natural waterways
ranging from around 5 to 25 days, with faster degradation observed with
high concentrations of dissolved organic matter and/or nitrates.
Transformation products have been identified and semi-quantified using
liquid chromatography coupled to (high resolution) mass spectrometry
with major products observed including multiple OH addition isomers,
breaking of the bridging alkyl chain, and aromatic ring opening.
Tentative structures and reaction mechanisms to produce those structures
are proposed based on exact mass analysis, retention time analysis, and
previous observations of hydroxyl and carbonate radical reactivities in
aqueous solutions. Finally, the photoproduct mixture was tested for
inhibition of the in vitro metabolism of bisphenol A by human cytochrome
P450s. Our results indicate that fluconazole is persistent in natural
waters and that slow natural indirect photolysis results in toxic and
likely persistent transformation products.</p>

<h2>Avoiding regrettable replacements: can the introduction of novel
functional groups move PFAS from recalcitrant to reactive?</h2>
<p><em>Andrew Folkerson and Scott Mabury</em></p>
<p>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a class of compounds
present in a range of commercial and consumer products. These chemicals
are often highly performing surfactants or non-stick/water repellant
coatings due to their innate chemical stability; however, due to this
stability select PFAS can be environmentally persistent. A novel group
of commercial surfactant building blocks
(F<sub>7</sub>C<sub>3</sub>-O-CHF-CF<sub>2</sub>-S-EtOH (FESOH),
F<sub>3</sub>C-O-CHF-CF<sub>2</sub>-S-EtOH (MeFESOH),
F<sub>7</sub>C<sub>3</sub>-O-CHF-CF<sub>2</sub>-O-EtOH (ProFdiEOH),
F<sub>7</sub>C<sub>3</sub>-O-CHF-CF<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-OH
(ProFEOH), F<sub>3</sub>C-O-CHF-CF<sub>2</sub>-O-EtOH (MeFdiEOH)) have
been developed with heteroatom linkages such as ethers and thioethers,
and polyfluorinated carbons, to facilitate degradation. The differing
degradation rates and products of these chemicals were investigated in
an atmospheric chamber to investigate their behaviour to inform their
fate in the environment. The complete fate of each molecule was studied
through both online high-resolution mass spectrometry via chemical
ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (CIMS-ToF), and off-line
bubblers to extract any acidic products for targeted identification and
quantification via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). FESOH and MeFESOH, the two compounds
with a thioether, were observed to have the shortest atmospheric
lifetimes, through OH radical oxidation, of 4.03 and 5.24 days
respectively. Interestingly, this additional trend of longer similarly
structured species reacting faster holds true for the ether species as
well (ProFdiEOH and MeFdiEOH). Additionally, by monitoring the OH
radical reaction with the FESOH congeners through the CIMS, we can
elucidate the identity of primary, secondary, and tertiary products, and
the time course of their relative abundances. Terminal acid products
quantification yielded PFPrA and shorter polyfluoroether acid species as
the terminal products for FESOH and ProFdiEOH, however, MeFESOH
demonstrated the propensity to completely mineralize, thus demonstrating
the importance of introducing these novel functional groups.</p>

<h2>Nitrous oxide profiles from the Canadian Atmospheric Laser
Absorption Spectrometer Experiment Test-bed</h2>
<p><em>Mark Panas and Jennifer Murphy</em></p>
<p>The Canadian Atmospheric Laser Absorption Spectrometer Experiment
Test-bed (CALASET) project aims to produce high quality profiles of
trace gases in the atmosphere using in-situ laser spectrometers on high
altitude ballon platforms. Vertical profiles of trace gases are
important for validating remote-sensing measurements. Two CALASET
instruments for measuring greenhouse gases were flown in an August 2022
field campaign in Timmins, ON. Results from one of the spectrometers
will be discussed here. This instrument is capable of measuring
CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, but the CO<sub>2</sub> retrieval was
unsuccessful due to the choice of spectral window. Additionally,
significant optical interferences and difficulty in predicting the laser
background hampered the retrieval of gas concentrations. Nevertheless,
N2O profiles from approximately 100 to 10 mbar were measured during the
ascent and descent portions of the flight with a precision of 1.1 ppb.
There was a significant offset between the ascent and descent mixing
ratios of about 20 ppb. This may be partially attributed to differences
in temperature of the atmosphere during the ascent and descent. These
profiles were compared to profiles from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)
on the Aura satellite. There was significant disagreement between MLS
and both the CALASET ascent and descent profiles, and the cause of the
disagreement is still unknown.</p>

<h2>Characterizing the oxidative potential associated with biomass
burning aerosol from Canada</h2>
<p><em>Bradley Isenor and Arthur Chan</em></p>
<p>With climate change on the rise, the looming threat of increased
wildfires and their associated pollutants, particularly particulate
matter (PM), is of great concern. These small, complex mixtures of
chemicals, found in smoke and other aerosols, have been linked to
numerous negative health effects and recent research suggests that PM
from biomass burning may be significantly more harmful than PM from
other sources. While the exact mechanisms through which PM causes harm
are still under investigation, the dominating view is that their
deleterious effects are primarily driven by their ability to trigger
oxidative stress after inhalation. To date, little research has explored
PM emitted from wildfires and even less on their abilities to induce
oxidative stress (i.e., oxidative potential, OP). The focus of this
research is to understand if and why PM emitted from wildfires are more
harmful than PM emitted from other sources. To address this research
question, the composition and OP of various biomass burning PM samples
from the field and the lab will be characterized. The dithiothreitol
assay will be used to measure the OP of PM and will be employed
alongside the electron paramagnetic resonance to identify and quantify
harmful environmentally persistent free-radicals and reactive oxygen
species. Finally, a chemical analysis of the PM (e.g., organic carbon,
elemental carbon, and levoglucosan content) will advance the
understanding of the connection between biomass burning organic aerosol
and human health.</p>

<h2>Field observations of size-resolved particulate alkyl amines in
urban Toronto during winter 2022-23</h2>
<p><em>Xiaoying Yang and Jennifer Murphy</em></p>
<p>Mainly emitted from anthropogenic activities, amines are N-containing
alkaline compounds that play an important role in enhancing new particle
formation and growth, despite their relatively low abundance in the gas
phase. From October 2022 to March 2023, size-resolved particulate amines
were measured using an eleven-stage micro-orifice uniform deposition
impactor (MOUDI) covering aerodynamic diameters from several microns
down to 0.056 μm in 23 sets of multi-day observation periods. Samples
were collected with cellulose and Teflon filters, but a positive
artifact was observed for cellulose filters that needs to be further
investigated. Dimethylamine and diethylamine were found to be
predominant amines in urban Toronto, contributing 0.1~3% of
water-soluble cation charges. Their mass loadings generally maximized at
~200 nm but were highest relative to ammonium in the smallest particles.
Using simultaneous measurements of gas-phase ammonia and the
solubilities of ammonia and amines, the range of gas phase concentration
of dimethylamine was estimated to be 10<sup>-2</sup> ~ 10<sup>-1</sup>
ppt, which could be relevant for new particle formation; while the gas
phase concentration of diethylamine was estimated to be 10<sup>-4</sup>
~ 10<sup>-3</sup> ppt. This observation strategy will be optimized and
applied for the following summer and winter measurements this year, to
elucidate the urban budget of amines throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Evaluation of adsorption isotherm models for determining the
partitioning of ammonia between soil and soil-pore water in
environmental samples and potential ammonia emissions sourced from
Toronto’s urban greenspace</h2>
<p><em>Matthew Davis and Jennifer Murphy</em></p>
<p>Ammonia in soil pore water (spw) is thought to participate in
bidirectional exchange with the atmosphere; however, common soil
nutrient analysis methods determine the bulk quantity of ammonia
associated with the soil particles, rather than determining the spw
ammonia concentration. To estimate the proportion of aqueous ammonia in
soils, previous studies have applied the Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherms to ammonia-enriched soils. In this work, environmental soil
samples were collected from green spaces in Toronto and used to evaluate
the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models to determine
their applicability to non-fertilized soils. We found that both models
can be used to represent the relationship between the amount of ammonium
adsorbed to the soil, S (mg/kg), and the bulk quantity of ammonia in the
extraction solution, C (mg/L), and thereby determine the ammonia
emission potential of our soil samples. By combining the equilibrium
vapor concentration associated with those emission potentials with our
two-year atmospheric ammonia monitoring record, we investigated the
parameters and conditions under which urban greenspaces would plausibly
contribute ammonia to the atmosphere. With environmental policy focusing
on controlling regional sources of ammonia, further research is needed
on the potential local sources that may become more influential to urban
air quality in the future.</p>

<h2>Oxidation of bisphenol A via gas-surface ozonolysis: chemical
transformation of a widespread organic pollutant</h2>
<p><em>Jie Yu and Jonathan Abbatt</em></p>
<p>Although bisphenol A (BPA) is a widely used chemical in food
packaging and plastic consumer products, it is also a well-known
synthetic estrogen that can disrupt the endocrine system. In Canada, the
use of bisphenol A is banned in baby products, so a set of alternatives
– structurally similar to BPA – has been developed and used in
“BPA-free” products. Research on alternatives’ safety is limited but
there are indications that some may also be endocrine disruptive. The
ubiquitous presence of BPA and its alternatives in ambient dust and
aerosol samples suggests the potential for transformation via
heterogeneous oxidation with atmospheric oxidants. However, studies on
the environmental fate of BPA and its alternatives are incomplete, with
uncertainties remaining in the loss kinetics of the parent chemicals and
in the identities and the associated health impacts of the
transformation products.</p>
<p>This study aims to address these uncertainties by studying the
gas-surface ozone oxidation of BPA under atmospherically-relevant
exposure conditions, with specific focus on kinetics and transformation
mechanisms. Laboratory ozonolysis was conducted for 2.5-nm-thick BPA
films in a flow reactor. Degradation of BPA and growth of four oxidation
products compounds were analyzed offline by LC-ESI-MS. These results are
supported by exposure experiments to genuine indoor air which contains
ozone, where thin BPA films and thermal paper containing BPA both showed
the appearance of the products observed in the flow reactor. These
results will aid in the evaluation of BPA environmental fate pathways,
future studies of the toxicity of these products, and prediction of the
oxidation products of BPA alternatives.</p>

<h2>The roles of temperature and pH in the gas-particle partitioning of
ionizable organics in the atmosphere</h2>
<p><em>Olivia Driessen and Jennifer Murphy</em></p>
<p>Atmospheric aerosols not only impact environmental and human health,
but also affect the global climate through direct and indirect radiative
forcing. Improved understanding of the roles played by individual
atmospheric vapors in new particle formation and particle growth is
required, particularly with shifting trends in anthropogenic emissions.
Traditionally, the inorganic constituents sulfuric acid, nitric acid,
and ammonia have been considered to dominate water-soluble secondary
aerosol, but this project aims to examine the role of alkylamines and
small organic acids in aerosol formation. Potentiometric titrations were
performed to determine the temperature dependence of the acid
dissociation constant of several amines, which is a key thermodynamic
parameter needed to predict their gas-particle partitioning. Enthalpies
of dissociation were measured for ammonia (53 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>),
methylamine (55 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>), and ethanolamine (47 kJ
mol<sup>-1</sup>). Gas phase amines are recognized as potent agents of
new particle formation, but their propensity to partition into acidic
aqueous aerosol limits their concentration in the gas phase. In
contrast, weak organic acids are typically not considered to have a
strong affinity for the aqueous aerosol phase relative to strong
inorganic acids. However, as SO2 and NOx emissions decrease while
emissions of NH3 are increasing, the potential for organic acids to
partition into the atmospheric aqueous phase (cloud and aerosol) is
growing. The gas-particle partitioning behavior of organic acids was
probed using chemical partitioning space analysis that considers the
role of excess ammonia in controlling aerosol and cloud pH.</p>

<h2>Identifying and quantifying atmospheric sources of organic
contaminants to the habitat of the St. Lawrence Estuary Belugas</h2>
<p><em>Jenny Oh and Frank Wania</em></p>
<p>Persistent organic contaminants, such as the polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs), have been shown to bioaccumulate in the Saint Lawrence
Estuary Belugas (SLEBs) and may be impacting their health. Atmospheric
deposition is often the dominant source of organic contaminants to
aquatic ecosystems and is likely also important in delivering PCBs to
the SLEB habitat. We quantified concentrations of organic contaminants
for the SLEBs in air, water and atmospheric deposition using networks of
passive air and water samplers across Quebec, coupled with active air
and deposition samplers in Tadoussac. The passive air sampling (PAS)
network encompassed the St. Lawrence River valley between Montreal and
Quebec City as well as the shores of the estuary up to Sept-Îles and
Sainte-Anne-des-Monts. Air concentrations of PCBs were elevated at most
sites along the Montreal-Quebec City corridor, consistent with the
region’s high population density and industrial history. Locally
elevated levels also point to the existence of PCB sources to the
atmosphere along the shores of the estuary (Sept-Îles) and in the
Lac-Saint-Jean region (Alma). Conversely, the PAS network could exclude
several electrical transformer stations as significant sources of PCBs
to the atmosphere. The analysis of many PCB congeners allows us to
employ multivariate statistical approaches to distinguish between PCB
sources related to the use of technical PCB mixtures and those resulting
from unintentionally produced PCBs. Combining our measurements with
atmospheric dispersion and deposition calculations, driven by historical
emission estimates, facilitates the estimation of the time-varying
atmospheric input of PCBs to the habitat of the SLEBs.</p>

<h2>Benchmarking a portable sensor for early warning monitoring of water
quality</h2>
<p><em>Zhuoyuan Li and Hui Peng</em></p>
<p>Microcystins (MCs) are toxic compounds produced by cyanobacteria
during harmful algal blooms (HABs) in freshwater sources, which can pose
significant health risks to humans including liver damage, respiratory
paralysis, and mortality. HABs typically occur in summer and autumn due
to environmental factors such as warm water, abundant sunshine, and
nutrient availability. Human activities such as agriculture,
urbanization, and industrialization have increased nutrient loads,
including nitrogen and phosphorus, in freshwater systems, which can
contribute to cyanobacterial dominance. Nitrate, an inorganic form of
nitrogen, is commonly used as an indicator of cyanobacterial dominance
due to its abundance and availability as a nitrogen source for
cyanobacteria. The established method for measuring nitrate and MCs in
surface waters is ion chromatography (IC) and mass spectrometry
separately. There is a need for portable and on-site measurement
methods.</p>
<p>In this study, a direct method using a prototype UV-VIS sensor system
provided by our industrial partner AUG Inc. was employed to measure
nitrate and humic acids levels in lake water samples by detecting full
wavelength absorbance. The sensor results were cross-validated with
laboratory testing using IC and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry
(HRMS). The findings showed that the UV-VIS sensor accurately measured
nitrate levels but was not reliable for indirect measurement of MCs
concentrations due to its low concentration. Ongoing research is trying
to upgrade the UV-VIS sensor to achieve the direct measurement of MCs
and other trace – level water contaminants.</p>
