<h2>Chemoproteomics identification of human liver fatty acid binding
protein as a protein target of triphenyl phosphate</h2>
<p><em>Jolie Miller and Hui Peng</em></p>
<p>Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is a widely used flame retardant and
plastic additive, part of the class of organophosphate esters (OPEs).
There is evidence that OPEs exhibit neurotoxicity through antagonistic
covalent binding to a serine residue within acetylcholinesterase, and
that this is not their only covalent interaction within the proteome.
TPHP has known toxic effects on endocrine, lipogenic, and immune
systems, many without clear molecular initiating events. In this
project, we use mass-spectrometry based chemical proteomics and
activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) to identify protein targets of
TPHP within the hepatic proteome. ABPP is a chemical labeling strategy
where proteins are exposed to a chemically analogous probe (in this
case, TPHP with an alkyne moiety), which is then reacted with a biotin
or fluorescent tag to mark where binding occurs.</p>
<p>We have utilized biotin affinity purification to isolate significant
hepatic protein targets of TPHP using high-resolution LC/MS, which lead
to the identification of human liver fatty acid binding protein
(hL-FABP) as a major target for covalent modification by TPHP. We then
evaluated the binding affinity of TPHP and other OPE compounds to
hL-FABP by using a fluorescence ANS displacement assay. This assay
demonstrated TPHP as a selective binder to hL-FABP and highlighted how
structural differences in OPE moieties can change binding affinity to
hL-FABP. Currently, we are working to identify sites of TPHP covalent
modification on hL-FABP using both shotgun and top-down proteomics. This
research identifies a novel protein target of TPHP and paves the way
toward identifying molecular initiating events for OPE toxicity.</p>

<h2>Development of a simplified oxygenated system for <em>in vivo</em>
solution state NMR</h2>
<p><em>Peter Costa and Andre Simpson </em></p>
<p>The use of flow systems is critical for sustaining aquatic organisms
for environmental toxicology and allowing for <em>in vivo</em>
solution-state NMR studies in their native and unaltered state. Current
approaches use flow lines that have the potential to burst and clog,
require large volumes of media, and multiple expensive HPLC pumps. The
“bubble pump” described here provides several unique advantages such as
no clogging, small and constant solution volume, and no need for pumps
or fluid lines in and out of the spectrometer. The system’s design
involves two core components: a dual slit adapter and an oxygen
generator. The addition of oxygen gas forms bubbles which rise and leave
an area of reduced pressure that pulls in water from above the double
slit and down into the chamber that contains the Daphnia. The result is
a constant flow of oxygenated water over the organism, operating solely
from one oxygen line. To evaluate the efficacy of the system, lactic
acid, a metabolite that is strongly associated with anoxic stress in D.
magna, is observed in the presence and absence of oxygen by
time-resolved monitoring using <sup>1</sup>H NMR. Without oxygen, there
is a large build-up of lactic acid after 10 hours. However, with a
continuous supply of oxygen, there is no lactic acid even after 22 hours
of exposure. The oxygenated flow system is designed for <em>in vivo</em>
solution-state NMR, for both large and smaller diameter probes with
potential applications in toxicity and metabolomics-based research.</p>

<h2>Soil organic matter biogeochemical trajectories are altered uniquely
with 66 years of litter manipulation in forests</h2>
<p><em>Isla Wrightson and Myrna Simpson</em></p>
<p>Global forest productivity has been altered greatly through climate
and anthropogenic changes. Although extreme drought and temperature have
lowered forest productivity in some regions, increased productivity has
been observed in many forests over the last few decades due to increases
in atmospheric CO2, temperature, nutrient deposition, and lengthened
growing seasons. Shifts in the composition and storage of soil organic
matter (SOM) are also mainly attributed to the perturbations in the
quality and quantity of plant inputs to the soil that accompany these
changes in productivity. Furthermore, soil carbon (C) is not linearly
related to detrital inputs as increased inputs do not always increase
soil C storage. Elevated plant inputs can induce soil respiration and
the activation of microbes, destabilizing the stored SOM and therefore
decreasing soil C storage in a process referred to as soil priming. This
is in contrary to assumptions made by early soil C models, thus making
predictions about future trends in soil C sequestration in response to
global change drivers difficult. To study the long-term compositional
changes to SOM in response to detrital changes, soil samples were
collected from the University of Wisconsin (UW) Arboretum after 66 years
of experimental treatments. The samples will be characterized using
targeted SOM compound analyses and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy. These complementary methods are able to discern changes in
SOM composition and degradation state and collectively, the results from
this project will provide unprecedented insight to biogeochemical
processes occurring at the molecular-level at the UW Arboretum.</p>

<h2>Aqueous nitration of phenols with dissolved nitrite: a formation
mechanism of atmospheric brown carbon</h2>
<p><em>Yutong Wang and Jonathon Abbatt</em></p>
<p>Light-absorbing organic compounds found in atmospheric particles are
commonly referred to as brown carbon (BrC), with nitrophenols being a
major contributor. The production of nitrophenols typically occurs via
direct emissions or through photochemical reactions involving phenols
and radicals like OH, NO2, and NO<sub>3</sub>. In this study, a dark
pathway for nitrophenol production is explored, which involves aqueous
HONO/NO2- and proceeds without apparent formation of OH radicals. The
reaction kinetics of a model aqueous system comprising of catechol and
NO2- are characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and UV-Visible spectrometry. The rate of reaction
is observed to increase from pH 4.4 to pH 3.4, along with a darkening of
the solution. Nitrocatechol, the first-generation nitration product of
catechol, is shown to undergo later-generation reactions, producing
additional chromophores with an absorption mode in the visible region
(425 nm). The generality of this reaction is demonstrated using aqueous
wood/peat smoke extracts through aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) and
UV-visible spectrometry, with both extracts exhibiting an increasing N:C
ratio and enhanced mass absorption coefficient (300 to 500 nm) upon
aqueous nitrite addition. The study also investigates the effect of
droplet evaporation, a physical aging process that aerosols and cloud
droplets go through, on this nitration mechanism, and the conditions
under which this pathway for BrC formation is more prevalent.</p>

<h2>An analysis of nitrate reactivity with volatile organic compounds
across Canada</h2>
<p><em>Brendan O’Connell and Jennifer Murphy</em></p>
<p>The nitrate radical (NO<sub>3</sub>) is a strong oxidant, which can
react with a wide array of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs),
particularly unsaturated compounds, leading to a permanent loss of odd
oxygen. Alternatively, NO<sub>3</sub> can react with NO2 to form N2O5,
which may be taken up on aerosol to form particle nitrate. However,
NO<sub>3</sub> can also react with NO or photolyze to reform NO2, thus
recycling nitrogen oxides. This work focuses on calculating the pseudo
first order loss rate of NO<sub>3</sub> with VOCs to determine which
reaction pathway dominates in the urban atmosphere. The nitrate
reactivity is calculated by summing the products of the concentration of
each VOC with its rate constant against NO<sub>3</sub>. The data used in
this study is from the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS)
program which monitors VOC concentrations using 24-hour integrated
observations collected every six days at monitoring sites across Canada
between 1995 and 2020. Analysis found that the overall reactivity of
NO<sub>3</sub> with VOCs has declined with time due to decreasing
concentrations of reactive VOCs in urban settings. Two key VOCs,
naphthalene and 2-methyl-2-butene, have historically dominated
reactivity with NO<sub>3</sub> but their dominance is declining due to
decreasing concentrations. α-Pinene and D-Limonene are the next most
reactive VOCs, and are becoming more important with time in terms of
total NO<sub>3</sub> reactivity. While the absolute reactivity of VOC
towards NO<sub>3</sub> has decreased, its importance as a sink has
likely increased in relative terms due to simultaneous decreases in
NOx.</p>

<h2>2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C experiments for targeted analysis of

<p><em>In-vivo</em> NMR is a powerful tool for tracking the biochemical
responses of organisms in response to environmental stress but has been
limited by poor resolution as a result of the extreme inhomogeneity of
living organisms, and in the chemical complexity of an organism.
Targeted pulse programs can support environmental studies, but often
discard information that might be useful in understanding the mode of
action of environmental stressors. To address these challenges, we
introduce two new targeted pulse sequences: an in phase anti-phase

and a 2D HCCH-TOCSY to obtain additional correlations whilst maintaining

<h2>Evaluating land-atmosphere fluxes of nitrogen species in the
Canadian Earth System Model</h2>
<p><em>Gavin McCurdy and Jennifer Murphy</em></p>
<p>My research is focused on evaluating the representation of
land-atmosphere nitrogen fluxes in the Canadian Earth System Model
(CanESM), specifically working with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme
Including Biogeochemical Cycles (CLASSIC) model, which is the
terrestrial component of CanESM. A nitrogen cycle was recently added to
the carbon cycle framework in the CLASSIC model. The main objective is
to assess whether the emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O, NO, and
NH<sub>3</sub> produced by CLASSIC can be used as inputs to the
atmospheric model when the two modules are fully coupled. These gases
play important roles in ozone depletion, oxidative capacity and climate
forcing within the atmosphere, but their emissions are typically
prescribed in atmospheric models. I am running a single-site version of
CLASSIC at a few locations with Fluxnet (meteorological) data to compare
the relative importance of internal and land-atmosphere fluxes of N. In
a 15-year simulation at the University of Michigan Biological Station,
annual emissions of N2O (0.52 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>), NO
(0.55 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>), and NH3 (0.89 kg N
ha<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>) accounted for only a small fraction of
the total conversion of soil NH4+ and NO<sub>3</sub>-. The emissions of
NO during the month of July (3.2 g N ha<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) are
larger than observations at the site (between 0.6-1.2 g N
ha<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). All three species’ emissions remain
relatively low and constant from September through April, increase
sharply in May, and remain high during the summer months
(June-August).</p>

<h2>The Influence of polar bears’ catabolic state and dietary
composition on the potential biomagnification of PCBs</h2>
<p><em>Yuhao Chen and Frank Wania</em></p>
<p>Passive equilibrium sampling (PES) is a powerful tool to
noninvasively derive the thermodynamic limit to an animal’s
gastrointestinal biomagnification capability (BMF<sub>lim</sub>) by
determining the ratio of the products of the volume (<em>V</em>) and
fugacity capacity (<em>Z</em>) of undigested and digested food. By
utilizing PES, we have identified a high-fat diet and a high digestion
efficiency as the two primary contributors to a high BMF<sub>lim</sub>.
This led us to hypothesize that an organism’s catabolic state can
influence its BMF<sub>lim</sub>. Cooperating with the Toronto Zoo, we
were able to study how an individual polar bear’s BMF<sub>lim</sub>
responds to seasonal changes in dietary composition and catabolic state
(the bears fast from December to June and feast from July to November).
Juno, the youngest bear, served as a reference since her diet varied
only little sasonally. Juno’s BMF<sub>lim</sub> reached a peak of ~60 in
March and dropped to ~37 in July and November, mainly due to a decrease
in the daily dietary ingestion rate (G<sub>food</sub>). The
BMF<sub>lim</sub> of Aurora and Nikita also peaked in March, at 244 and
60, respectively, but decreased to a minimum of 39 and 12, respectively,
in July before rising again to 61 and 50, respectively in November.
Dramatic reductions in BMF<sub>lim</sub> were due to a decrease in
G<sub>food</sub> and the dietary lipid content (causing
<em>Z</em><sub>food</sub> to decrease), while the increase in
BMF<sub>lim</sub> toward the end of the fasting period was caused by a
higher digestion efficiency.</p>

<h2>Exploring proton-only NMR experiments and filters for Daphnia <em>in
vivo</em>: potential and limitations</h2>
<p><em>Kiera Ronda and Andre Simpson</em></p>
<p>With increasing industrialization, the environmental impacts of
anthropogenic activities has become an area of growing concern.
Therefore, it is essential to understand the impacts of contaminants on
environmental health. NMR metabolomics has shown great potential in this
area, due to its non-targeted nature and ability to analyze complex
samples in their unaltered states. <em>Daphnia magna</em> are one of the
key species used for these studies as they are small enough to survive
inside a 5 mm NMR tube.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity of biological samples, 1D proton spectra have a
high-degree of overlap, with extensive information buried beneath broad
lipid signals. Spectral dispersion is greatly improved in 2D
experiments, therefore most studies to date have used
<sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C 2D NMR of <sup>13</sup>C-enriched
organisms. With the soaring costs of <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment (~600%)
making culturing enriched organisms much less accessible, it is
important to ask, “can any meaningful information be extracted from the
proton-only NMR of living Daphnia”?</p>
<p>To address this, two samples are evaluated. The first consist of
intact lyophilized Daphnia reswollen in D<sub>2</sub>O, as the organisms
produce sharper signals after death. Conversely, <em>in vivo</em>,
organisms swim inside a flow system of 100% water, resulting in lipid
dominated spectra. As seen in Figure 1, a wealth of information is
present in the reswollen organisms and solvent suppression is trivial,
whereas aggressive suppression is required for the <em>in vivo</em>
sample. The costs and benefits of various proton-only experiments will
be investigated to determine the extent of information that can be
obtained without organism enrichment.</p>

O<sub>3</sub> into permeable surfaces depend on RH, and the partitioning
of SVOCs may also be affected by RH. This suggests that RH will affect
O<sub>3</sub> reactivity, however, an understanding of these processes
is limited. This work addresses how O<sub>3</sub> deposition on a
permeable surface (painted surface) is affected by a model unsaturated
SVOC (terpineol) at different RHs. Firstly, to quantify O<sub>3</sub>
deposition on a painted surface, O<sub>3</sub> was passed through a
chamber (with painted surfaces on the top and bottom) and O<sub>3</sub>
was monitored at varying RHs. Then, terpineol uptake on a painted
surface was quantified by measuring the sorbed mass of terpineol using
an online mass spectrometer at different RHs. Lastly,
O<sub>3</sub>-terpineol reactivity was studied, where O<sub>3</sub> was
introduced to a terpineol-conditioned chamber and was monitored at
varying RHs. It was found that increased RH increases O<sub>3</sub>
deposition and terpineol partitioning into the paint. Also, the presence
of terpineol increases ozone deposition, emphasizing the importance of
SVOC-O<sub>3</sub> surface reactions on indoor air quality.</p>
